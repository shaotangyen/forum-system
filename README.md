# HobbyForum

Welcome to the hobby forum. This is a community driven forum to discuss hobbies and interests.

As someone from the Traditional Chinese community (zhTW), there are not many forums out there for people to discuss their favourite topics rather than Facebook groups and Discod channels. So the idea was to build a forum system where people can gather around and discuss topics of their interest.

The goal for this project was to create a simple forum and posting system where users can login/logout, create and manage forums, create creative posts and leave comments of other userâ€™s posts.

Due to time limitation, the forum layer of the website is not done yet. But the post management and comment section works fine, with a beautiful HTML editor for your creativity. Enjoy!
